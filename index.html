    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The first and immediate response to the crisis was universities shifting into a
    ‘business resilience mode’ and making attempts to simply replicate their traditional learning environment on the web.
    But, in the absence of proper infrastructure (learning platforms, secure virtual sessions, internet connectivity,
    integrated systems, online assessments etc), content (self-paced audio-video lessons, self-learning textual material,
    PowerPoint presentations, question banks..) and past experience (faculty training, student support, online interaction
    management, student orientation, engagement issues), most institutions are struggling to get their acts together.
    And with the semester-end examinations looming on their heads, most universities are trying their best to find out a
    solution to maintain academic continuity and promote their students.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Learning never exhausts the mind!!
    Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. 
    In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. 
    As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt
    at the time of the Middle Kingdom. Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607. Plato founded the 
    Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens 
    as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse 
    of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>
